@title{Moby: the Moby Scheme Compiler}

@section{What is Moby?}

Moby is a project from the PLT Scheme team.  The Moby compiler
consumes Advanced Student Language (ASL) programs that use @link["http://world.cs.brown.edu/"]{World}
primitives, and produces applications for mobile platforms.  The
current prototype supports desktop browsers and smartphones.
Our long-term goal is to make Scheme the premiere reactive scripting
language for mobile phones.

Shriram Krishnamurthi presented the ideas behind Moby at ILC 2009 in
his talk @link["http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Talks/Moby-Bootstrap/"]{The Moby Scheme Compiler for Smartphones}.

    


    
@section{Running Moby from DrScheme}


To use Moby from DrScheme, create a file in the Module language, and
at the top of your program, include the following language line:

@mobyblock[
]

followed by the program.  For example, running the program:

@mobyblock[
(define initial-world 0)
(js-big-bang initial-world (on-tick 1 add1))
]

will invoke a web browser, which should show the
running program on a web page.  Because @scheme[on-tick] is used, 
as every second passes, the runtime sends a tick stimulus to the program.  
The page should also provide links to download packages
of the compiled program.



These programs run on the user's web browser; they can also dynamically
generate DOM trees and style them with CSS, as in the examples below.

The following example renders the world as a paragraph of text, styled
with a font-size of 30.  It uses @scheme[draw-html] and @scheme[draw-css]
to draw the web page.

@(mobyblock
(define initial-world 0)
  
(define (draw-html w)
  (list (js-p '(("id" "myPara")))
        (list (js-text "hello world"))))

(define (draw-css w)
  '(("myPara" ("font-size" "30"))))

  
(js-big-bang initial-world
             (on-draw draw-html draw-css)))


The next example shows an image and an input text field.  As with the
previous example, it uses @scheme[draw-html] and @scheme[draw-css] to
construct the web page, and every time the world changes, the runtime environment
reacts by re-drawing the web page.

@mobyblock[
(define (form-value w)
  (format "~a" w))

(define (update-form-value w v)
  (string->number v))

(define elt
  (js-input "text" update-form-value))

(define (draw-html w)
  (list (js-div)
        (list (js-img "http://plt-scheme.org/logo.png"))
        (list elt)
        (list (js-p '(("id" "aPara")))
              (list (js-text (format "~a" w))))))

(define (draw-css w)
  '(("aPara" ("font-size" "50px"))))

(js-big-bang 0
             (on-draw draw-html draw-css))]





@section{The Moby World API}
@(declare-exporting/this-package [src/moby-lang] [])
  

@defproc[(js-big-bang (a-world world) (handlers handler?) ...) void]{
A Moby program starts a reactive computation with @scheme[js-big-bang].
The rest of the arguments hook into the reactive computation.

By default, the page that's displayed contains a rendering of the world value.
In the presence of an @scheme[on-draw] or @scheme[on-redraw] handler, @scheme[js-big-bang] will
show a customized view.

The majority of the handlers register different stimuli that can trigger changes
to the world.  One
instance is @scheme[on-tick], which registers a function to update
the world on a clock tick.
}



@defproc[(on-draw [to-dom (world -> (DOM-sexp))]
                  [to-css (world -> (CSS-sexp))]) scene]{
One of the main handlers to @scheme[js-big-bang] is @scheme[on-draw], which controls how
the world is rendered on screen.  The first argument computes a
rendering of the world as a DOM tree, and the second argument computes
that tree's styling.
}


                                                                                                                 
@defproc[(on-redraw [hook (world -> scene)]) handler?]{
For simple applications, @scheme[on-redraw] is sufficient to draw a scene onto the display.
The following program shows a ball falling down a scene.

@(mobyblock
(define WIDTH 320)
(define HEIGHT 480)
(define RADIUS 15)

(define INITIAL-WORLD 0)

(define (tick w)
  (+ w 5))

(define (hits-floor? w)
  (>= w HEIGHT))

(check-expect (hits-floor? 0) false)
(check-expect (hits-floor? HEIGHT) true)

(define (render w)
  (place-image (circle RADIUS "solid" "red") (/ WIDTH 2) w
               (empty-scene WIDTH HEIGHT)))

(js-big-bang INITIAL-WORLD
             (on-tick 1/15 tick)
             (on-redraw render)
             (stop-when hits-floor?)))
}


@defproc[(stop-when [stop? (world -> boolean)]) handler?]{
When the world should be stopped --- when @scheme[stop?] applied to the world
produces @scheme[true] --- then the @scheme[js-big-bang] terminates.

The program:
@(mobyblock
(define (at-ten x)
  (>= x 10))

(js-big-bang 0
             (on-tick 1 add1)
             (stop-when at-ten))
)
counts up to ten and then stops.
}



@subsection{Types}

A @scheme[dom-sexp] describes the structure of a web page:

@schemegrammar[dom-sexp (list dom-element dom-sexp ...)]


a @scheme[css-sexp] describes the structure of a page's styling:

@schemegrammar[css-sexp (listof (cons (or dom-element string)
                                      (listof attrib)))]

An @scheme[attrib] is a:
@schemegrammar[attrib (list string string)]

Each of the @scheme[dom-element]s can take in an optional attribute list to
assign to the new dom element; the common useful attribute is a key-value binding for an "id",
which can be used to identify an element in the css-drawing function.


Here are examples  of a dom-expr and a css-sexp.
@schemeblock[
(define a-dom-sexp (list (js-div '(("id" "main-div")))
                         (list (js-text "Hello world"))))

(define a-css-sexp (list (list "main-div"
                               (list "background" "white")
                               (list "font-size" "40px"))))
             ]


@subsection{@scheme[dom-element] constructors}

Here are the dom-element constructors.

@defproc[(js-div (attribs (listof attrib?) '())) dom-element?]{
Constructs a div element.}


@defproc[(js-p (attribs (listof attrib?) '())) dom-element?]{
Constructs a paragraph element.}

@defproc[(js-button (world-update-f (world -> world)) 
                    (attribs (listof attrib) '()))
         dom-element]{
Constructs a button.  When the button is pressed, the world is updated through @scheme[world-update-f].

The following example counts how many times a button has been clicked.
@(mobyblock
(define (press w)
  (add1 w))

(define (draw w)
  (list (js-div)
        (list (js-button press) (list (js-text "Press me")))
        (list (js-text (format "Button presses: ~a" w)))))

(define (draw-css w)
  '())

(js-big-bang 0
             (on-draw draw draw-css))
)
}
                     
                     

@defproc[(js-button! (world-update-f (world -> world))
                     (effect-f (world -> effect))
                     (attribs (listof attrib) '()))
         dom-element]{
Constructs a button.  When the button is pressed, the original world is updated,
and the original world is used to construct an effect.
}

@defproc[(js-text (text string?)) dom-element]{Constructs regular text.}

@defproc[(js-input (type string)
                   (world-update-f (or/c (world string -> world)
                                         (world boolean -> world)))
                   (attribs (listof attrib) '()))
         dom-element]{
Creates an input form element.  The types that are currently supported are:
@itemlist[@item{@scheme["text"]}
          @item{@scheme["password"]}
          @item{@scheme["checkbox"]}]
When the user changes the content of the form element, the runtime
uses @scheme[world-update-f] to update the world.  If the
@scheme[type] is either @scheme["text"] or @scheme["password"], then
the string value of the element will be passed as the second argument
to it.  If @scheme[type] is @scheme["checkbox"], a boolean
representing the checked status of the element will be passed to it.

The example below has a single text input form element, which allows the user to enter
some value.
@(mobyblock
(define (refresh w form-val)
  form-val)

(define input-node
  (js-input "text" refresh '(("id" "myname"))))

(define (draw w)
  (list (js-div)
        (list (js-div) (list (js-text (format "I see: ~s~n" w))))
        (list (js-div) (list input-node))))


(define (draw-css w)
  '())

(js-big-bang ""
             (on-draw draw draw-css))
)


The example below uses a checkbox to select among three elements:
@(mobyblock
(define (make-ingredient-checkbox-sexp ingredient)
  (local [(define (on-check w v)
            (cond
              [v
               (cons ingredient w)]
              [else
               (remove ingredient w)]))]
    (list (js-div)
          (list (js-text ingredient))
          (list (js-input "checkbox" 
	                  on-check
			  `(("value" ,ingredient)))))))

(define c1 (make-ingredient-checkbox-sexp "mushrooms"))
(define c2 (make-ingredient-checkbox-sexp "green peppers"))
(define c3 (make-ingredient-checkbox-sexp "olives"))

(define (draw w)
  (list (js-div)
        c1
        c2
        c3
        (list (js-text (format "The world is: ~s" w)))))

(define (draw-css w)
  '())

(js-big-bang '()
             (on-draw draw draw-css)))
}





@defproc[(js-img (url string) (attribs (listof attrib) '())) dom-element]{Creates an image element.
}

@defproc[(js-select (options (listof string?)) (world-update-f (world string -> world)) (attribs (listof attrib) '())) dom-element]
Constructs a select element with the given options.  Whenever a new
option is selected, the @scheme[world-update-f] function is called to
get the new world.

The example below has a select with five elements.
@(mobyblock
(define (select-house w an-option)
  an-option)

(define a-select-element
  (js-select (list ""
                   "Gryffindor"
                   "Hufflepuff" 
                   "Ravenclaw"
                   "Slytherin")
             select-house))

(define (draw w)
  (list (js-div)
        (list a-select-element)
        (list (js-text (format "House: ~a" w)))))

(define (draw-css w)
  '())

(js-big-bang ""
             (on-draw draw draw-css))
)

             
             
@subsection{Stimulus Handlers}

Stimulus handlers are provided as additional arguments to a js-big-bang.

Each stimulus has an effect-less and an effect-full version; the effect-full
version allows you to provide an effect-generating function as well as a world-updater.  When
the given stimulus emits, the old world is used to compute both
the new world and the optional effect.  Afterwards, each effect in the
effect group is applied.

@schemegrammar[effect atomic-effect
                      (listof effect)]


@deftogether[(
              @defproc[(on-tick (delay number)

                        handler])]{
Calls the acceleration handlers when the device feels change in acceleration.
}



@subsection{Effects}

world.  These are used in conjunction with the effect (@scheme[!]) version of the
stimulus handlers described above.

           @item{@link["http://ant.apache.org"]{Apache Ant >=1.7.1}}
           @item{@link["http://developer.android.com"]{Google Android SDK >= 1.5r3}}
           ]

Moby finds these by using @scheme[find-executable-path]; make sure that
@exec{ant} and the @exec{android} binary are in your path; Moby will use
your PATH variable to find Apache Ant and the Android SDK.


You can verify that @exec{android} and @exec{ant} can be found
with the following at the interactions window:

@schemeblock[(find-executable-path "android")]
@schemeblock[(find-executable-path "ant")]

Both of these expressions must return non-false values for Moby
to be able to build packages.

Running a Moby program generates a web page with links to run the
program; once the Android SDK has been successfully installed, the
link that's named "Generate Android APK" will generate an Android
package.




@section{Underlying developer details}
    
The compiler takes a ASL program and translates it to Javascript code.
Moby reimplements the ASL primitives in a Javascript runtime library
that's included with the compiled application.  (See
doc/moby-developer-api.txt for more details.)

To support smartphones, Moby uses a bridge library called Phonegap, which
provides access to the native facilities of several cell phones.  In
this way, Moby should be able to support multiple platforms with a lot
of code reuse.  Moby handles the other libraries (tilt, location, sms,
music), though with support only for the Android platforms for now.


@subsection{Developer Dependencies}

Moby is mostly written in PLT Scheme, and the project sources are
hosted by github.com.  To develop with Moby, you will need the
following:

@itemize[
  @item{@link["http://plt-scheme.org"]{PLT Scheme >=4.2}}
   @item{@link["http://git-scm.com"]{git}}
  ]


@subsection{Setting up the Moby sources from github}
Moby is used as a PLaneT package; to install Moby from the development sources and set
up a PLaneT local link.

Download the Moby source, currently hosted on 
        @link["http://github.com/dyoo/moby-scheme/tree/devel"]{github}
    and place them somewhere convenient.
    

    For example, 
@verbatim{
        $ cd ~/work
        $ git clone git://github.com/dyoo/moby-scheme.git moby
}
    downloads the developer sources.
    
    Next, add a PLaneT local link to the moby directory:
    
@verbatim{
        $ planet link dyoo moby.plt 2 <<some-high-number>> moby
}

    with @tt{<<some-high-number>>} replaced with a number greater than the latest released version of Moby.
    
    
    Once this is done, the development link should be established, and you should be able to use
    Moby as before.


@subsection{Running Moby from the command line}


You can run the Moby command line utility (@filepath{moby/src/moby.ss}) on a Moby
program to produce a compiled version of your application.  Moby
supports two output backends, both which rely on Javascript:
@itemize[
          @item{js: compiles to a web page application, which can be deployed on
      any web server.}

           @item{js+android-phonegap: compiles to an Android .apk application
      package; can also use features of the mobile platform.}
]

By default, the command line utility will use the js backend.

Let's run moby on the falling-ball.ss example in
@filepath{moby/examples/falling-ball.ss}.  We can first generate a web program.
@verbatim{
    $ cd moby/examples
    $ mred ../src/moby.ss falling-ball.ss
    $ cd FallingBall/
    $ ls
    index.html  main.js  runtime  test
}
If you open up index.html from your web browser, you should see a red
ball falling down the screen.




Furthermore, we may want to generate an Android application.
@verbatim{
    $ cd moby/examples
    $ mred ../src/moby.ss -t js+android-phonegap falling-ball.ss
    $ cd FallingBall
    $ ls
    AndroidManifest.xml  build.properties    gen               res
    assets               build.xml           libs              src
    bin                  default.properties  local.properties  tests

    $ ls bin
    classes  classes.dex  DroidGap.ap_  DroidGap-debug.apk
}

@filepath{DroidGap-debug.apk} is the compiled Android binary.  The Ant @filepath{build.xml}
build-script in the @filepath{FallingBall} directory can install, uninstall, and
reinstall the application if the Android emulator is online.
@verbatim{
    $ ant install
Buildfile: build.xml

[some output cut]

install:
     [echo] Installing bin/DroidGap-debug.apk onto default emulator...
     [exec] 1594 KB/s (120997 bytes in 0.074s)
03:38 I/ddms: Created: [Debugger 8610-->1641 inactive]
03:38 I/ddms: Good handshake from client, sending HELO to 1641
     [exec]     pkg: /data/local/tmp/DroidGap-debug.apk
     [exec] Success
03:39 I/ddms: Closing [Client pid: 1641]

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 6 seconds
}

After this, you can look at the Android emulator, which should now
have the @filepath{FallingBall} application installed.










@subsection{Compiler}

Moby consists of the following core files for the compiler:
@itemize[
          @item{@filepath{src/compiler/beginner-to-javascript.ss}: translates Scheme programs to
    javascript programs.}

           @item{@filepath{src/compiler/env.ss}: maintains the environment structures that map
    identifiers to bindings.}

           @item{@filepath{src/compiler/permission.ss}: defines a list of capabilities that a function
    can be tagged with.}
           
           @item{@filepath{src/compiler/toplevel.ss}: maps the primitive toplevel names available in
    the base language.}
           
           @item{@filepath{src/compiler/modules.ss}: adds a few extensions to the toplevel language,
    including the reactive world primitives.}

           @item{@filepath{src/compiler/pinfo.ss}: maintains program information used to analyze a
    program and figure out what functions are used and what
    capabilities are needed.}

           @item{@filepath{src/compiler/desugar.ss}: applies syntactic transformations on programs
                  to a core form.}
           
           @item{@filepath{src/compiler/helpers.ss}: auxillary helper functions.}
]

The compiler is intentionally written in a small superset of the language
(@filepath{src/compiler/lang.ss}).  As a consequence, it is self hosting, and we take
advantage of this to produce a running compiler on the browser.
(@filepath{support/js/test/test-repl.html})

@itemize[
          @item{@filepath{src/compiler/bootstrap-js-compiler.ss}: compiles @filepath{beginner-to-javascript.ss}
                against itself to produce @filepath{support/js/compiler.js}.}]


@subsubsection{An example}

Let's see what beginner-to-javascript.ss gives us:

@verbatim{
    > (define p '((define (f x)
                    (* x x))
              
                  (f 3)))

    > (define cp (program->compiled-program p))
}

@scheme[program->compiled-program] consumes a program --- a list of
s-expressions --- and produces a @scheme[compiled-program] structure.

@verbatim{
    > cp
    #<compiled-program>
}

The compiled program consists of a list of toplevel definitions and
expressions.

@verbatim{
    > (compiled-program-defns cp)
    "\nfunction f(x) { return plt.Kernel._star_([x,x]); }"

    > (compiled-program-toplevel-exprs cp)
    > cp
    #<compiled-program>
}

The compiled program consists of a list of toplevel definitions and
expressions.

@verbatim{
    > (compiled-program-defns cp)
    "\nfunction f(x) { return plt.Kernel._star_([x,x]); }"

    > (compiled-program-toplevel-exprs cp)
    "(function (toplevel_dash_expression_dash_show0) { \n\ntoplevel_dash_expression_dash_show0((f((plt.types.Rational.makeInstance(3, 1))))); })"
}

If we want to embed the evaluation of this program in a web page, we
can use the two strings above to do so.  For convenience, we provide a
helper function @scheme[compiled-program-main] that ties both the definitions
and expression evaluation together.







@subsection{Runtime}


The Javascript program that's emitted depends on a runtime kernel
that's currently implemented in Javascript.  See the files in
@filepath{support/js/runtime}.

@;{
@subsection{Ugly Hacks}


The afterAttach() hack: one problem with excanvases in IE is that they
can't render until they're attached to a parent node.  Unfortunately,
this means that we can't render a canvas at a call to a value's
pretty-printing routine, because that value isn't yet attached to the
DOM.

This affects the implementation of plt.Kernel.BaseImage.toDomNode() We
currently add an DomNodeInserted listener to the dom node value, so it
knows when it's time to render.  However, this doesn't work under IE
(again), so we also add an afterAttach method that all of our methods
will call as soon as we add to a DOM node.  So you'll see code
sprinkled around that says:
@verbatim{
    if (node.afterAttach) { node.afterAttach(); }
}
in the following files:
@itemize[
          @item{@filepath{support/js/runtime/jsworld.js}}
           @item{@filepath{support/js/runtime/jsworld/jsworld.js}}
           @item{@filepath{support/js/runtime/types.js}}
           @item{@filepath{support/js/runtime/kernel.js}}
]
}

@subsection{Bindings from ASL}

The following toplevel bindings are available from Moby, and have the
same meaning as in @link["http://docs.plt-scheme.org/htdp-langs/advanced-prim-ops.html"]{Advanced Student Language}.
